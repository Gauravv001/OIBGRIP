                <h5>Career Highlights</h5>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ Lee’s entry into the Timely Comics in 1939 proved to be a big step in his career. He
                        started
                        out by doing menial jobs but soon made his comic-book debut with the text filler ‘Captain
                        America Foils the Traitor's Revenge’.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ In 1941, Lee started getting opportunities to do actual comics with a backup feature. He
                        created the ‘Destroyer in Mystic Comics No. 6’, ‘Jack Frost in USA Comic No. 1’ and ‘Father Time
                        in Captain America Comics No.6’.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ When he was only 19 years old, owing to a conflict in the company and his escalating
                        creativity, Lee was made interim editor of the company and worked with the company for a good 31
                        years, mostly as editor-in-chief.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ In 1942, he joined the United States Army and served stateside in the Signal Corps. He
                        continued his creative streak there by writing manuals, training films and slogans, which is why
                        he was classified in the military as ‘playwright’.</strong>

                <p>
                    <strong>✔ After finishing his stint with the army, Lee joined back the company in 1950s, which was
                        now
                        known as the ‘Atlas Comics’. He started experimenting with various genres––writing romantic,
                        sci-fi, horror, humorous stories, etc.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ For this assignment, Lee, in association with his colleague Jack Kirby, created a team of
                        superheroes called ‘Fantastic Four’ with superheroes like, ‘Hulk’, ‘Iron Man’, ‘Thor’,
                        ‘Spider-Man, ‘X-Men’, ‘Doctor Strange’, etc.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ Throughout 1960s, he scripted, art-directed and edited most of Marvel's series while
                        moderating the letters pages. He was also writing a monthly column, ‘Stan’s Soapbox’. His job
                        was getting very taxing but Lee, for once, was enjoying it.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ In 1971, Lee was asked to write a story on bad-effects of drugs and he thought of
                        including
                        it in ‘The Amazing Spider-Man’. The Comics Code Authority was against it because the portrayal
                        of drugs was against the code.
                    </strong>

                <p>
                    <strong>✔ Lee and Goodman went ahead with it anyway and published the story in their comics. The
                        story
                        got really famous and Marvel was appreciated for spreading the responsible message. The CCA
                        abolished the Code and permitted negative depictions of drugs.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ From 1975, he was more busy and gained popularity as a figurehead and public face for
                        Marvel
                        Comics. He attended the comic book conventions around America, lectured at colleges and
                        participated in panel discussions.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ In 2001, Lee formed ‘POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment’ with Gill Champion and
                        Arthur
                        Lieberman, in order to create film, television and video game properties. He also launched the
                        ‘Stan Lee's Sunday Comics’.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>✔ When Lee finished his 65 years with Marvel, it honored him in 2006 with the publication of
                        a
                        series of one-shot comics in which Lee was shown interacting with his co-creations like
                        ‘Spider-Man’, ‘Doctor Strange’, etc.
